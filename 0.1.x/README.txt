DAM Frontend is providing a powerful possibilty to select files out of the dam.

Main features:
* display category trees in the frontend to select files
* combine categories via "or selection" 
* combine category selections via "and" selections between two cat trees
* providing File Downloads, which are manually selected via a second plugin
* Downloading files via a "pushfile", so that the fileadmin area can be secured via a .htaccess file
* Set up download restrictions via categories for fe_users / fe_groups (not finished yet!)

Important:
Language issue: currently there is no language overlay for the dam itsself. So if you're displaying categories or records from the dam, it is displayed as it is stored in the dam.

Roadmap:
* Upload Feature
* RealURL Support
